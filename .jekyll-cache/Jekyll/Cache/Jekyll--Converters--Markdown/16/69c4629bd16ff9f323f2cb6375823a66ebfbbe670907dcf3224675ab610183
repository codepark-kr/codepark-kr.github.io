I"<p>BlackDoc is a two-column <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> theme that’s ideal for websites that require a master-detail layout for viewing of content. It’s based on <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a>, the Jekyll butler, and the <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a> theme.</p>

<p>I needed a two-column layout with a scrolling sidebar to publish my <a href="http://karloespiritu.com/cheatsheets">code cheatsheets</a>, and found the <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a> Jekyll theme to be a good starting theme. To complement the color scheme of my main <a href="http://karloespiritu.com">website</a>, I customised the theme to make it look great in black background and changed the sidebar to display scrolling content. I created this theme because I can’t seem to find any good Jekyll theme with a master-detail layout. Hopefully, someone will find this useful as well in their own projects.</p>
