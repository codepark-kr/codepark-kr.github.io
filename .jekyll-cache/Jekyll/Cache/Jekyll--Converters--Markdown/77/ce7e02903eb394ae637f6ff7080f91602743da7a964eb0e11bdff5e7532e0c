I"J<p>Alright, so ‘m testing for write something first.
This one service Markdown syntax like Notion Also Velog. Specially the platform called Velog used almost 1 year to archive ‘bout database and jdbc before, but just one thing, couldn’t accept the content area was <strong><em>too narrow!</em></strong> When I recognize the fact, I couldn’t stand for it. At that time the idea of Jekyll got stroke me but thought like my skill for handling that is not enough surely. Anyway, time has come. Now ‘m the junior Back-end Developer, finally can try this.
